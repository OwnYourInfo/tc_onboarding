TC Developer Onboarding
================================


BACKGROUND
----------

### Market

http://thetrustedcloudcompany.com • Check out current branding and messaging of the new umbrella company.

http://ownyourinfo.com • This is the original product. Get a feel for what we were going for it and what it is that will be informing the baseline apps.

http://respectnetwork.com • Home of the network we’re building all of this on top of, where you’ll find short descriptions of high-level concepts in the FAQ and glossary. 

### Technical

http://guides.rubyonrails.org/engines.html • In order to get the most out of OwnYourInfo we’re going to break up some of its existing functionality into gems and engines.

http://xdi2.projectdanube.org • XDI is the fabric of the personal cloud ecosystem. Here you’ll find links to the source code, the Oasis committee and the wiki page. The XDI applications are great tools for learning about the syntax and debugging code.

https://github.com/projectdanube/xdi-js • The first version of the XDI ruby client was built as a port of this library. We’ll probably be using this library in tandem with the Ruby client.
